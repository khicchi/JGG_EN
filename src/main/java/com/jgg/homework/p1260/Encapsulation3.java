  //         Setter method of <make> should not assign null or empty values to <make> field
  //         Setter method of <year> should not assign null to <year> field
  //         Setter method of <year> should not assign values bigger than 2025 to <year> field
  //         Create a constructor which accepts make and year as parameter.
  //         Constructor should use setters of each field to assign the values
